# Deep-Learning
MIE1517 Deep Learning course at University of Toronto 

Assigment 2: Hand Gesture Recognition
- Generate and preprocess your own data
- Load and split data for training, validation and testing
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network
- Apply transfer learning to improve your model

Assignment 3: Image Colourization

- Clean and process the dataset and create greyscale images.
- Implement and modify an autoencoder architecture.
- Tune the hyperparameters of an autoencoder.
- Implement skip connections and other techniques to improve performance.
- Implement a cGAN and compare with an autoencoder.
- Improve on the cGAN by trying one of several techniques to enhance training.
